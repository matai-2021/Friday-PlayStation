      <h2>Back-story</h2>
      <p>{`Before corona virus, one of the founding members, Dylan, was on holiday in Brazil, visiting Rodrigo's family and he missed the rest of his team. He wanted to send a postcard to his
        othe rmembers of his company but there was no postshop in the town that he was staying in. This made him remember the company he helped create "DIGI MY CARD". He hopped on his computer
        and typed in //digi-my-card.com and decided to share his memories through a digital postcard to Meli,Kritika and Suji!`}</p>
